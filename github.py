# when a grp of 3-4 people works on a project, then they have to merge their files at one place
# Ex: instead of share code on mails, dropbox, we use github,gitlab, bitbucket
# GIT -  DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM , how can we push opur project to github repository
# u can think repository as a folder- where u can put all ur files , online storage like g-drive & dropbox
# To save a file: click on commit file
# files ki history ko save krke rkhta hai git,

"""
(ctrl+alt+s) for opening version control dialog box: very imp , from directory mappings we can do many things...(git to vcs) & (vcs to git)


to export to github (pushing to website):    vcs->create git repository-> vcs-> share project on github->name ur repo->select all ->done.....
to import from github (pulling from website):  vcs->get from version control->fill the copy url from github->open in new window->done....

and ye import hua project humara, pycharm projects mein save ho jaayega......


when wew work with git, we have two things: local repository and remote repository
on commit, it will save that in a local repository, it means the changes we made dont reflect in github website/remote repository
so, we have to push that project on the remote repository : ye (commit and push) ek saath bhi ho jaata haii........
